# Hello-World
The first sentence after becoming a programmer
This includes the source code and compiled program of the program to print out "HelloWorld" in multiple languages. You can download them at [Releases](https://github.com/Someone-Of-Liu/Hello-World/releases/tag/1.3.0) page.

I don't mean to show off. After all, I only know two or three languages. I just want to commemorate the first program made when we programmers became programmers.

This project will be constantly updated, and I also believe that I can master more programming languages in the future and become a professional programmer. So, this project also records my growth process and everything I have gained on the road of programming. This is the road I have traveled, and it is the road you have traveled or will travel.
More importantly, I hope that all of us will not forget our original intention and move forward.          ————Don’t forget why you started when you went too far.
